## About this project

SAP Automation Pilot is a low-code/no-code automation engine that's part of the SAP Business Technology Platform. It's goal is to simplify and automate complex manual processes in order to minimize the operational effort behind any cloud solution in the SAP BTP.

The remote work processor extends these capabilities to Kubernetes by leveraging the [operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/) - the go to solution for automation in Kubernetes. Without the need of any coding, ops teams can create and run Kubernetes operators with ease.
